# CurrencyConverter

CurrencyConverter is an application that converts USD, EUR and GBP into SEK.\
The application will automatically change the SEK amount when the user \
changes the currency amount. The user chooses which currency to convert.\
A chart is available to follow the currencies growth for the past 8 days.\
The reason that it is only 8 days is API restrictions in free mode.
